**Description**    
The project represents the database of a company that acts as an intermediary between furniture manufacturers and their customers—specifically, a furniture transport company.
Essentially, the furniture ordered by a customer from multiple furniture suppliers affiliated with the company will be transported to the customer by this service.
The utility of this model comes from the significant reduction in transportation costs since the customer pays a single transporter instead of paying multiple transport agencies—one for
each furniture manufacturer they purchased from.
Additionally, another advantage of this model lies in the organization of purchased products under a single entity before delivery (potentially all at once).
This avoids waiting times between the deliveries of different furniture pieces and prevents potential inconveniences caused by lost items.
For better understanding, I will provide an example: one of the many courier companies that serve multiple publishing houses.
